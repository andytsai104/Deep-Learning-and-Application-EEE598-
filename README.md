## Introduction to DL
This is the first assignment for this class. In this assignment, I've learnt the funcdamental concepts of deep learning. In the fisrt part of this assignment, I implemented data collection, model training and parameters optimization with Teachable Machine. 
In the second part, I learnt HPC task automation with the supercomputer (SOL) in ASU. I set up the environment for the following 

## Unserstanding Perceptrons and basic models (MLP)
This assignment is conducted in 3 main parts: 
1. Understanding Perceptrons: This section covers not only the basic idea of perceptrons, but it also shows how perceptrons work in hyperplane. First, 
2. Backpropagation: 
3. MLP v.s.KANs: 



## Vision DL Models
